This repository contains BEAST source code, modified for the purposes
of the IE-ORIGINS project at the Department of Linguistics, UC Berkeley.
It was obtained via:

  svn checkout http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ beast-mcmc-read-only

It is now maintained as a git repository.

I compiled and installed it (on Linux) in this manner:

(1) Run ant to build everything.

  ant

(2) Set the root of the local repository to $BEAST.  Also set $BEAST_LIB.

  export BEAST=/path/to/repo
  export BEAST_LIB=$BEAST/lib

(3) Link beast.jar and beuti.jar into $BEAST_LIB.

  cd $BEAST_LIB
  ln -s ../build/dist/*.jar .

(4) Put $BEAST/release/Linux/scripts in the path.

  export PATH=$BEAST/release/Linux/scripts:$PATH
